If you removed the pages and you didn\u2019t set up different URLs to which the server\\nshould redirect requests for those pages, then a 404 response is correct.\\n\\nNo penalty as such but indirect impact on your website is evident, when you have so much of web pages 404. 404 says the\\npage is not found but it doesn\'t say the page is deleted or permanently deleted and the visitor is not going to find it\\nagain.\\n\\nGoogle understands that. They\u2019re reporting 404 responses, not errors. You\u2019re not being hurt because your server responds\\nwith a 404 when Googlebot requests pages that you\u2019ve removed. You are potentially passing up on a benefit, however. If\\nthose pages had a decent amount of link equity, that equity would be passed on to pages to which you redirected requests\\nfor the old pages. This would also make for a better user experience. Of course, all of this is based on the assumption\\nthat you\u2019d be redirecting to pages that served to provide people looking for the old pages with the information they\\nseek.\\n\\n### Waste of Crawl Budget\\n\\nWith 404, Google waits for 2 to 3 months to ensure the page is removed. With 404, the Other impact would be that you\\nwaste your crawl budget. The crawler spends time in crawling the periods which are not present on your website. This\\nlead to trouble in discovering new pages on your website.\\n\\nWith more pages failing, Google reduces your crawl budget over time. This will reduce the timely indexing of new pages\\non your website.\\n\\n### Possible Solution?\\n\\nIt is better to issue 410 since it instructs that the page is permanently deleted. This helps Google to remove the URL\\nfrom its index quickly. The next time Googlebot visits the page and sees the 410 status code, Google will then remove\\nthe page from it\u2019s index within 24 hours. Google will never check again to see if the page has come back.\\n\\nHere are some different types of HTTP status codes:\\n\\n    100s: Informational requests\\n    200s: Successful requests\\n    300s: Redirects\\n    400s: Client-side errors\\n    500s: Server-side errors\\n\\nDepending on your browser, the 410 error can appear in a few different ways:\\n\\n    410 Gone\\n    Gone\\n    Error 410\\n    HTTP Status 410"},{"id":"python-seo-analyzer","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/python-seo-analyzer","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-03-python-seo-analyzer.md","title":"Python SEO Analyzer","description":"Get started","date":"2022-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 3, 2022","tags":[{"label":"python","permalink":"/blog/tags/python"},{"label":"seo","permalink":"/blog/tags/seo"},{"label":"seo-analyzer","permalink":"/blog/tags/seo-analyzer"}],"readingTime":0.415,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lejen","title":"Just a person","url":"https://lejencodes.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/lejencodes.png","key":"lejencodes"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"python-seo-analyzer","title":"Python SEO Analyzer","authors":["lejencodes"],"tags":["python","seo","seo-analyzer"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Attempt To Fix 404 Error Google Search Console","permalink":"/blog/attempt-to-fix-404-error-google-search-console"},"nextItem":{"title":"Repo Clone with SSH","permalink":"/blog/repo-clone-with-ssh"}},"content":"## Get started\\n\\nRequires Python 3.6+, BeautifulSoup4 and urllib3.\\n\\n## Install by using pip\\n\\n    pip3 install pyseoanalyzer\\n\\n## Command-line Usage\\n\\nIf you run without a sitemap it will start crawling at the homepage.\\n\\n    seoanalyze https://lejencodes.com/\\n\\nOr you can specify the path to a sitemap to seed the urls to scan list.\\n\\n    seoanalyze https://lejencodes.com/ --sitemap https://lejencodes.com/sitemap.xml\\n\\nHTML output can be generated from the analysis instead of json.\\n\\n    seoanalyze https://lejencodes.com/ --sitemap https://lejencodes.com/sitemap.xml --output-format html\\n\\nRun From cloned Repository\\n\\n    python analyzer.py https://lejencodes.com/ -f html > results.html"},{"id":"repo-clone-with-ssh","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/repo-clone-with-ssh","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-06-repo-clone-with-ssh.md","title":"Repo Clone with SSH","description":"This will save up alot of your time trying to fix SSL Error, certification problem","date":"2022-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 6, 2022","tags":[{"label":"repo","permalink":"/blog/tags/repo"},{"label":"ssh","permalink":"/blog/tags/ssh"}],"readingTime":1.01,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lejen","title":"Just a person","url":"https://lejencodes.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/lejencodes.png","key":"lejencodes"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"repo-clone-with-ssh","title":"Repo Clone with SSH","authors":["lejencodes"],"tags":["repo","ssh"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Python SEO Analyzer","permalink":"/blog/python-seo-analyzer"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"This will save up alot of your time trying to fix SSL Error, certification problem\\n\\n1.

When Everything Seems too Easy\\n\\nMy first impression when I first hands on a RPA Tool, everything seems so easy because of the drag and drop features, pre-built functions, puzzle like building blocks that allow you to construct a sequence of actions just at your fingertips. The creator of these tools made it so easy to implement and deploy automation, this causes a lot of headaches and technical debts down the road if we do not do our homework to have a full understanding of what we are trying to automate and what control are needed in-place.\\n\\n### 2. Rush into RPA\\n\\nDue to the hype related to RPA technologies. When we first started to adopt RPA in our company oftentimes we made a huge mistake calculating ROI by just using \'Current Time Spent\' minus \'Future Time Spent\' without really think and consider about infrastructure and cost of maintenance. This often due to our team rushing to build up momentum, wanted to prove the capabilities of the tool and most importantly to get buy in from upper management. But realistically most of the current processes is not ready, ended up the team is spending more time maintaining the bot than the manual process.\\n\\n### 3. No everyone can do it well\\n\\nToo naive to think that everyone can use the tool that have been offered. Business user often been asked to attend RPA course and started to automate some of their task. Unfortunately, most of these automation developed were not properly tested, and assume everything is been taken care automatically. We normally started off working on the \\"Happy Path\\" without considering the scenario that are usually more complicated than that. These could be variant of an input or the input can be in a differnet format that you expect. RPA can complete your job 10x faster, but also can create mistake 10x faster.\\n\\n### 4. Just focus on building and Robots are ready, set and forget\\n\\nFrom day one of deploying our first bot, not a single bot can be set and forget. Bot needed to be manage operationally and maintained. We have made mistakes for not properly documenting and communicating automated process with business SMEs. When a bot breaks, no-one will know how to recover the process and leads to unnecessary over-time to figure what had happen and what needed to be done.\\n\\nOn the other hand, due to rapidly changes in business requirements, system upgrade and process changes have causes us lots of bot down-time. Getting involvement of IT and Business SMEs and knowing these changes before hand could reduce unneccesary over-time trying to fire fight to get your bot up and running again.\\n\\n### 5. Failing to Scale, not building for scalability\\n\\nAfter 3 years of RPA experience. Started to feel the impact of not building for scalability. Most of our solutions were built in silo mode rather than enterprise-wide. We are much now spending alot of time re-visiting our solution, re-designing our bots.\\n\\nAnother mistake which was choosing the right candidate processes for RPA, we had wrong thinking about using automation as a quick fix which now end up deploying multiple bots which are doing similar job while ideally they could be designed as a single bot."},{"id":"keep-your-free-heroku-app-alive","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/keep-your-free-heroku-app-alive","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-02-keep-your-free-heroku-app-alive/index.md","title":"Keep Your Free Heroku App Alive","description":"Thanks to Heroku, now I have my personal site :)","date":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 2, 2022","tags":[{"label":"heroku","permalink":"/blog/tags/heroku"},{"label":"cronjob","permalink":"/blog/tags/cronjob"}],"readingTime":1.81,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lejen","title":"Just a person","url":"https://lejencodes.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/lejencodes.png","key":"lejencodes"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"keep-your-free-heroku-app-alive","title":"Keep Your Free Heroku App Alive","authors":["lejencodes"],"tags":["heroku","cronjob"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Top 5 Mistakes I Made as RPA Developer and Common Pitfall","permalink":"/blog/top-5-mistakes-i-made-as-rpa-developer-and-common-pitfall"},"nextItem":{"title":"AWS - Block Public Access Settings in S3","permalink":"/blog/aws-block-public-access-settings-in-s3"}},"content":"~~Thanks to Heroku, now I have my personal site :)~~\\n\\nToo bad, heroku no longer offer free dyno..\\n\\n> If an app has a free web dyno, and that dyno receives no web traffic in a 30-minute period, it will sleep.\\n\\n> Every Heroku account is allocated a pool of free dyno hours, which can be used by Personal apps - apps that are not part of a Heroku Team or Enterprise Team.\\n\\nIf you want to know more about free dyno hours, visit official site [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours)\\n\\n# Method - Cron-job\\n\\nI am using a free tier account and I don\'t want my visitor to wait for dyno to re-launch everytime when they visit the site.

When dumping my coffee grounds to the bin and I am thinking how much of coffee waste do we produce per as a coffee drinker.\\n\\n## How Much Coffee Waste Do We Produce?\\n\\nAccording to the SCA, the \u201cgolden ratio\u201d for brewing coffee is 55g per litre. This works out at just under 14g for a 250ml cup. While this might seem individually insignificant, billions of cups of coffee are consumed every single day.\\n\\n## Waste in Coffee Production\\n\\nSo why is coffee production so bad for the environment? The decomposition of coffee waste in landfills generates greenhouse gases and whenever these are dumped into landfills, they create methane which are more harmful than carbon dioxide\\n\\n## Reusing Coffee Grounds At Home\\n\\nAs what I have been doing, majority of used coffee is often thrown to the bin without being separated or treated. I did some googling and found some good ways of reusing coffee ground at home\\n\\n- Coffee grounds make great fertilizer because they contain several key nutrients required for plant growth. They can also help attract worms and decrease the concentrations of heavy metals in the soil.\\n\\n- Adding compost to your garden can significantly improve the health of your plants. Coffee grounds can help increase nutrient levels and decrease the greenhouse gas emissions of your compost.\\n\\n- Like other insects, fleas do not like coffee. Bathing your pet in used coffee grounds may help keep fleas at bay.\\n\\n- Coffee grounds can help absorb and eliminate odors from your refrigerator, gym bag or smelly shoes. Using them as a hand scrub can also help remove lingering smells from onion or garlic.\\n\\n- Coffee grounds can be used as an abrasive cleaner. They can help sanitize and remove buildup from sinks, cookware, grills and other surfaces around the house.\\n\\n- Coffee grounds can be repurposed into an exfoliating scrub for your face and body. They help remove dirt and dead skin cells and promote overall skin health.\\n\\n- Coffee grounds contain compounds that are toxic to many insects. You can use your coffee grounds to repel mosquitos, fruit flies, beetles and other pests.\\n\\n- Coffee grounds may help reduce the appearance of cellulite by breaking down fat deposits and increasing blood flow to the affected area.\\n\\n- Use coffee grounds to weigh down the ashes in your fireplace before cleaning. This makes for easier ash removal and less mess.\\n\\n- Coffee grounds can be repurposed into an exfoliating scrub for your face and body. They help remove dirt and dead skin cells and promote overall skin health.\\n\\n- Coffee grounds contain natural acids and enzymes that help tenderize meat and enhance its flavor.\\n\\n- You can use coffee grounds to buff out scratches on wooden furniture and darken them to match your existing finish.\\n\\n- Coffee grounds contain caffeine and antioxidants. When applied to the skin, they can help prevent aging and reduce the appearance of dark under-eye circles and puffiness.\\n\\n- Coffee grounds contain compounds that can raise blood cholesterol. Consuming small amounts on occasion is fine for most people, but they may be problematic if consumed in excess."},{"id":"do-you-vape","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/do-you-vape","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-25-do-you-vape/index.md","title":"Do you vape?","description":"Vaper since Year 2015.

Divide and Conquer\\n\\nThis stay on the top as it\'s the most important principle, for instances when we are being provided with a business case with huge list of requirements, we started to confuse ourselves and often the solution came up straight away potentially not the best solution. The idea of divide is to decompose a given problem into two or more similar, sub-problems, which then we conquer by composing solutions to the give problem.\\n\\n## 2. Increase cohesion\\n\\nA good object oriented design must be loosely coupled and highly cohesive. This design principle have been created based on the idea of `Loose coupling and high cohesion`. Don\'t mixed up with Cohesion and Coupling, as cohesion refers to what a class, module or function can do. Low cohesion would means that it does great variety of action being unfocused on what it should do. Another way to think of this is to have something that could not be broken down further, and should be doing only one thing.\\n\\n**Example of Low Cohesion:**\\n\\n| Staff            |\\n| ---------------- |\\n| check_email()    |\\n| send_email()     |\\n| email_validate() |\\n| get_salary()     |\\n\\n**Example of High Cohesion:**\\n\\n| Staff         |\\n| ------------- |\\n| -salary       |\\n| -email_add    |\\n|               |\\n| set_salary()  |\\n| get_salary()  |\\n| set_email_add |\\n| get_email_add |\\n\\n## 3. Reduce coupling\\n\\nThis refers to how related or dependent of two classes / modules. Low coupled would mean that changing something in major should not affect the other. High coupling would increase the difficulties of code maintenance, a change of module usually forces a ripple effect of changes in other modules. The lesser dependencies the better\\n\\n## 4. Increase abstract\\n\\nAbstraction is one of the key principles behind many of the OO design principles such as below and is the hardest in my opinion. The idea is to have a simplified version of something technical and the goal is to reduce complexity.\\n\\n- Inheritance\\n- Polymorphism\\n- Composition\\n- Benefits of abstraction\\n- Code is easy to understand\\n- Manages change and the effect of change\\n- Creates cohesive code \u2013 it finds common fields\\n- Create loose coupling\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete)\\n\\n> abstraction is the ability to view a complex operation in a simplified form. A class interface provides an abstraction of the implementation that\u2019s hidden behind the interface\\n\\nSome examples below:\\n\\n**Concrete**\\n\\n    place_triangle(triangle)\\n    place_square(square)\\n    place_circle(circle)\\n\\n**Abstract**\\n\\n    place_shape(shape)\\n\\nYou will just lock down the attributes like x, y, areas\\n\\n## 5. Increase re-usability\\n\\nThink of writing codes as re-usable as possible, the challenge part could be keeping the balance on spending more time to design and write a general function. I see this as a investment of time to reduce the future time needed to go back and understand the piece of code.\\n\\n## 6. Design for flexibility\\n\\nThink ahead and anticipate that the fact of there will be a change in the future, as and when the business grows, requirement changes and more. A-lot of time when comes to an end of project, I realised that I have to add some features and based on the way I have written my codes, that\'s not possible. Ending up spending more time to re-write and re-design the whole program.\\n\\n## 7. Anticipate Obsolescence\\n\\n- Avoid early release and version of software\\n- Use software from reputable companies\\n- Use as few external dependencies as possible\\n- Avoid poorly documented or maintained projects\\n\\n## 8. Design for portability / scalability\\n\\nThink ahead about possibility to have your program in other platform. Things can get harder when your client based grows and you do not have the ability to scale your program or port to another platform.\\n\\n## 9. Design for testability\\n\\nThis is important especially for larger code based project. Design the code in a way that you are able to test the code. Think of test case, functional test, unit test, and find out a way to test the code.\\n\\n## 10. Design defensively\\n\\nIdiot proof your code. Good error messages, handling all the invalid input, handling wrong output."},{"id":"python-refactoring","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/python-refactoring","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-11-python-refactoring.md","title":"Python Refactoring","description":"Trying to understand what is refactoring, follow the guide from Real Python. https://realpython.com/python-refactoring","date":"2022-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 11, 2022","tags":[{"label":"python","permalink":"/blog/tags/python"},{"label":"refactoring","permalink":"/blog/tags/refactoring"}],"readingTime":3.655,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lejen","title":"Just a person","url":"https://lejencodes.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/lejencodes.png","key":"lejencodes"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"python-refactoring","title":"Python Refactoring","authors":["lejencodes"],"tags":["python","refactoring"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Top 10 Design Principles","permalink":"/blog/top-10-design-principles"},"nextItem":{"title":"Using ssh-agent with Visual Studio Code on Windows 10","permalink":"/blog/using-ssh-agent-with-visual-studio-code-on-windows-10"}},"content":"Trying to understand what is refactoring, follow the guide from Real Python. https://realpython.com/python-refactoring\\n\\n1.

Converting \u201cTriangular\u201d Code to Flat Code\\n\\nThese are the symptoms of highly nested code:\\n\\n    A high cyclomatic complexity because of the number of code branches\\n    A low Maintainability Index because of the high cyclomatic complexity relative to the number of lines of code\\n\\n```py\\ndef contains_errors(data):\\n    if isinstance(data, list):\\n        for item in data:\\n            if isinstance(item, str):\\n                if item == \\"error\\":\\n                    return True\\n    return False\\n```\\n\\nRefactor this function by \u201creturning early\u201d\\n\\n```py\\ndef contains_errors(data):\\n    if not isinstance(data, list):\\n        return False\\n    return data.count(\\"error\\") > 0\\n```\\n\\nAnother technique to reduce nesting by list comprehension\\n\\nCommon practise to create list, loop through and check for criteria.\\n\\n```py\\nresults = []\\nfor item in iterable:\\nif item == match:\\nresults.append(item)\\n```\\n\\nReplace with:\\n\\n    results = [item for item in iterable if item == match]\\n\\n4. Handling Complex Dictionaries With Query Tools\\n\\nIt does have one major side-effect: when dictionaries are highly nested, the code that queries them becomes nested too.\\n\\n```json\\ndata = {\\n \\"network\\": {\\n  \\"lines\\": [\\n    {\\n     \\"name.en\\": \\"Ginza\\",\\n     \\"name.jp\\": \\"\u9280\u5ea7\u7dda\\",\\n     \\"color\\": \\"orange\\",\\n     \\"number\\": 3,\\n     \\"sign\\": \\"G\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n     \\"name.en\\": \\"Marunouchi\\",\\n     \\"name.jp\\": \\"\u4e38\u30ce\u5185\u7dda\\",\\n     \\"color\\": \\"red\\",\\n     \\"number\\": 4,\\n     \\"sign\\": \\"M\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you wanted to get the line that matched a certain number, this could be achieved in a small function:\\n\\n```py\\ndef find_line_by_number(data, number):\\n    matches = [line for line in data if line[\'number\'] == number]\\n    if len(matches) > 0:\\n        return matches[0]\\n    else:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\"Line {number} does not exist.\\")\\n```\\n\\n    find_line_by_number(data[\\"network\\"][\\"lines\\"], 3)\\n\\nThere are third party tools for querying dictionaries in Python. Some of the most popular are JMESPath, glom, asq, and flupy.\\n\\n```py\\n\\nimport jmespath\\n\\njmespath.search(\\"network.lines\\", data)\\n[{\'name.en\': \'Ginza\', \'name.jp\': \'\u9280\u5ea7\u7dda\',\\n\'color\': \'orange\', \'number\': 3, \'sign\': \'G\'},\\n{\'name.en\': \'Marunouchi\', \'name.jp\': \'\u4e38\u30ce\u5185\u7dda\',\\n\'color\': \'red\', \'number\': 4, \'sign\': \'M\'}]\\n```\\n\\nIf you wanted to get the line number for every line, you could do this:\\n\\n    > > > jmespath.search(\\"network.lines[*].number\\", data)\\n    > > > [3, 4]\\n\\nYou can provide more complex queries, like a == or <. The syntax is a little unusual for Python developers, so keep the documentation handy for reference.\\n\\nFind the line with the number 3\\n\\n    > > > jmespath.search(\\"network.lines[?number==`3`]\\", data)\\n    > > > [{\'name.en\': \'Ginza\', \'name.jp\': \'\u9280\u5ea7\u7dda\', \'color\': \'orange\', \'number\': 3, \'sign\': \'G\'}]"},{"id":"using-ssh-agent-with-visual-studio-code-on-windows-10","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/using-ssh-agent-with-visual-studio-code-on-windows-10","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-10-using-ssh-agent-with-visual-studio-code-on-windows-10.md","title":"Using ssh-agent with Visual Studio Code on Windows 10","description":"Enable the ssh-agent service","date":"2022-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 10, 2022","tags":[{"label":"ssh-agent","permalink":"/blog/tags/ssh-agent"},{"label":"ssh","permalink":"/blog/tags/ssh"},{"label":"ssh-key","permalink":"/blog/tags/ssh-key"},{"label":"vscode","permalink":"/blog/tags/vscode"},{"label":"windows","permalink":"/blog/tags/windows"}],"readingTime":7.37,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lejen","title":"Just a person","url":"https://lejencodes.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/lejencodes.png","key":"lejencodes"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"using-ssh-agent-with-visual-studio-code-on-windows-10","title":"Using ssh-agent with Visual Studio Code on Windows 10","authors":["lejencodes"],"tags":["ssh-agent","ssh","ssh-key","vscode","windows"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Python Refactoring","permalink":"/blog/python-refactoring"},"nextItem":{"title":"Make another branch as master","permalink":"/blog/make-another-branch-as-master"}},"content":"### Enable the ssh-agent service\\n\\nTo enable SSH Agent automatically on Windows, start PowerShell as an Administrator and run the following commands:\\n\\n```\\n# Make sure you\'re running as an Administrator\\nSet-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic\\nStart-Service ssh-agent\\nGet-Service ssh-agent\\n```\\n\\n### Adding ssh keys\\n\\nRun these commands in a terminal window within Visual Studio Code.\\n\\nShow keys managed by the ssh-agent\\n\\n```\\nssh-add -l\\n```\\n\\n### Add a ssh key\\n\\n```\\nssh-add\\n```\\n\\nFor git, add a system environment variable or use a temporary setting in a PowerShell terminal of VSCode.\\n\\n$env:GIT_SSH=\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\OpenSSH\\\\ssh.exe\\"\\n\\nIf you add the line `$env:GIT_SSH=\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\OpenSSH\\\\ssh.exe\\"` to your Powershell profile the environment variable will always be used.\\n\\nhttps://www.cgranade.com/blog/2016/06/06/ssh-keys-in-vscode.html\\n\\n# Using SSH Keys in Visual Studio Code on Windows\\n\\n[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\xa0is Microsoft\u2019s\xa0[open-source](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\xa0code editor for Windows, OS X and Linux. Nicely, VS Code has built-in support for Git and support for Python through\xa0[an extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python), making it a useful for scientific development. Using VS Code on Windows is somewhat frustrated, however, if you want to work with a Git repository that was cloned using SSH. Thankfully, I found a workable solution using PuTTY and Git for Windows, such that VS Code transparently works with password-protected SSH keys. Below, I detailed how I got it working in as complete a detail as reasonable, but you may have already done some or even many of these steps. If so, the procedure is actually fairly simple, and consists of pointing Git (and hence VS Code) to use PuTTY and Pageant instead of the SSH version that ships with Git for Windows.\\n\\nFirst, though, a disclaimer. These steps worked on my Windows 10 installation, but may not work on yours. If you find that this is the case, let me know, and I\u2019ll try and update accordingly.\\n\\n## Step 0. Install Required Software\\n\\nBefore we get into things, we\u2019ll need a bit of software. In particular, we\u2019ll need:\\n\\n- [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)\xa0as a native-Windows SSH client and agent,\\n- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)\xa0to use Git from PowerShell and VS Code, and\\n- [OpenSSH for Windows](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH)\xa0to generate SSH keys in the first place.\\n\\n**_WARNING_**: Do\xa0**_not_**\xa0install PuTTY from its official homepage, as this will download PuTTY over an insecure connection. This guide will cover how to download PuTTY securely.\\n\\nFor much of this, we can use the\xa0[Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/)\xa0for Windows to save some grief, so let\u2019s start by installing that. If you already have Chocolatey, please skip this step. (If you aren\u2019t sure, try running\xa0`choco`\xa0from PowerShell.) Run PowerShell as administrator, then run the following command to download and install Chocolatey:\\n\\n```\\nPS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process RemoteSigned\\nPS> iwr https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex\\n```\\n\\nOnce this is done, close and reopen PowerShell (again as administrator). This will make\xa0`choco`\xa0available as a command. Now we can use it to install Git and OpenSSH (as above, we will\xa0*not*\xa0install PuTTY using Chocolatey, as it will download PuTTY from its official homepage using an insecure connection). Run the following PowerShell commands to install Git and OpenSSH:\\n\\n```\\nPS> choco install git\\nPS> choco install win32-openssh\\n```\\n\\nWe\u2019ll finish up by downloading the version of PuTTY that ships with\xa0[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/), since that version is delivered via HTTPS and not insecure HTTP. In particular, use\xa0[this link](https://winscp.net/download/putty-0.67-installer.exe)\xa0to download PuTTY, then run the installer once you\u2019ve downloaded it.\\n\\n## Step 1. Setup Private Keys\\n\\nOnce everything is installed, we now need to make sure that you have an SSH private key and that this key is registered with your Git hosting service (for instance, GitHub or Bitbucket). If you already have keys and have registered them with your hosting provider, please skip on ahead.\\n\\nIn any case, to generate keys, we\u2019ll again use PowerShell:\\n\\n```\\nssh-keygen\\n```\\n\\nSimply follow the prompts to make yourself a new public/private key pair, making sure to choose a long (~40 character) passphrase. This passphrase provides much of the entropy for your key, such that it should be much longer than a typical password.\xa0**Never**\xa0type your passphrase into a remote password prompt\u2014 the passphrase is used to unlock your key locally on your machine, and should\xa0**never**\xa0be sent over the network. If a website asks you for your SSH passphrase, you are probably being scammed.\\n\\nBy default, the new keys will be located in\xa0`C:\\\\Users\\\\<username>\\\\.ssh\\\\id_rsa`\xa0and\xa0`C:\\\\Users\\\\<username>\\\\.ssh\\\\id_rsa.pub`. As the names suggest, the first of these is the\xa0*private*\xa0key and should not be shared with anyone. The other is the public key, and serves to identify yourself to others. Follow the instructions for\xa0[GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)\xa0or\xa0[Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/add-an-ssh-key-to-an-account-302811853.html)\xa0(for Bitbucket, make sure to follow the Linux and OS X instructions, even from Windows) to upload your\xa0*public*\xa0key to your hosting provider.\\n\\n## Step 2. Set up SSH Agent\\n\\nNext, we\u2019ll make sure that your private key is setup in an SSH agent. This will securely remember your passphrase within a given session, so that you don\u2019t have to type it in every time you use it. In particular, we\u2019ll configure Pageant, since this is installed with PuTTY, and works well with a variety of command-line and GUI tools for Windows\u2014 most notably, with VS Code.\\n\\nPageant must be run at startup in order to be useful, so we\u2019ll begin by adding it to the startup folder now. In Windows Explorer (Windows 8.1 and earlier) or in File Explorer (Windows 10 and later), go to the folder\xa0`C:\\\\Users\\\\<username>\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup`. Right-click inside this folder and select\xa0`New \u2192 Shortcut`. From there, browse to\xa0`C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\PuTTY`\xa0and select\xa0`pageant.exe`.\\n\\nNext, we need to import your new key into PuTTY/Pageant.\\n\\n1. Run PuTTYgen from the Start Menu and select\xa0`File \u2192 Load Key...`.\\n1. From there, navigate to\xa0`C:\\\\Users\\\\<username>\\\\.ssh\\\\`\xa0and select\xa0`id_rsa`\xa0(the private key). You may have to drop down the file types selector in the dialog box to see this, as PuTTYgen defaults to filtering out everything but files ending in\xa0`*.ppk`. Once selected, you\u2019ll be prompted by PuTTY to unlock your key by typing in your passphrase. Do so, and PuTTYgen will show the corresponding public key.\\n1. Select\xa0`File \u2192 Save private key`\xa0to export your private key in PuTTY, rather than OpenSSH, format. I suggest saving it as\xa0`id_rsa.ppk`\xa0in the same folder as\xa0`id_rsa`, but this is up to you. Just be sure that to save it in a folder that only you can read, and that is not synchronized using Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive or similar.\\n\\nFinally, run Pageant from the Start Menu (in the future, this will be handled automatically by the shortcut we created above). This will add a new icon to your system tray. It may be hidden by the arrow; if so, click the arrow to make all fo the system tray icons visible. Right-click on Pageant and select\xa0`Add Key`. Browse to where you saved\xa0`id_rsa.ppk`\xa0and select it. You\u2019ll be prompted to unlock your key. Upon doing so, your unlocked key will then be made available in Pageant until you log out or quit Pageant.\\n\\n## Step 3. Add SSH Server Fingerprints\\n\\nDespite the name, this is a short step. Whenever you log into an SSH server, PuTTY will check that the server\u2019s\xa0*fingerprint*\xa0is correct. This is a short cryptographic string identifying that server, such that checking the fingerprint helps against man-in-the-middle attacks. If you haven\u2019t logged into a server with PuTTY before, however, it has no idea how to check the fingerprint, and will fail to login. Since VS Code ignores these errors, Git support will silently fail unless you first attempt to log into the SSH server offered by your Git host. To do so, we\u2019ll use PowerShell one last time. Run one of the following commands below, depending on which hosting provider you use.\\n\\n```\\nPS > & \'C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\PuTTY\\\\plink.exe\' git@github.com\\nPS > & \'C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\PuTTY\\\\plink.exe\' git@bitbucket.org\\n```\\n\\nIn either case, you\u2019ll be prompted to add the server\u2019s fingerprint to the registry. If you are confident that your traffic is not being intercepted, select\xa0`y`\xa0at this prompt. Neither GitHub nor Bitbucket actually allows logins via SSH, so you\u2019ll get an error, but this is OK: you\u2019ve gotten far enough to see the server\u2019s fingerprint, and that\u2019s all we needed. To check, you can run the commands above again, and note that you are no longer prompted to add the fingerprint, but instead fail immediately.\\n\\n## Step 4. Configure Environment Variables\\n\\nWe\u2019re almost done. All that\u2019s left is to point Git for Windows at PuTTY and Pageant, rather than its own built-in SSH client. Since VS Code uses Git for Windows, this will ensure that VS Code does what we want.\\n\\n1. Right-click on\xa0`My Computer`\xa0or\xa0`This PC`\xa0in Windows/File Explorer, and select\xa0`Properties`.\\n1. From there, click\xa0`Advanced system settings`\xa0in the sidebar to the left. On the\xa0`Advanced`\xa0tab, press the\xa0`Environment Variables...`\xa0button at the bottom.\\n1. Finally, click\xa0`New...`\xa0on the user variables pane (top), and add a new variable named\xa0`GIT_SSH`\xa0with value\xa0`C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\PuTTY\\\\plink.exe`.\\n1. You may want to use\xa0`Browse File...`\xa0in this dialog box to make sure you get the path correct.\\n1. Once done, press\xa0`OK`\xa0to add the variable,\xa0`OK`\xa0again to close the Environment Variables dialog, then\xa0`OK`\xa0a third time to close System Properties.\\n1. Finally, close the System window."},{"id":"make-another-branch-as-master","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/make-another-branch-as-master","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-05-make-another-branch-as-master.md","title":"Make another branch as master","description":"Since the task was to simply use another branch instead of\xa0master, you can simply remove\xa0master\xa0branch completely or rename it to let\'s say -\xa0legacy, then take another branch and rename it to\xa0master.

Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.\\n\\n2. Run the following command to amend (change) the message of the latest commit:\\n\\n```git\\ngit commit --amend -m \\"New commit message.\\"\\n```\\n\\nWhat the command does is overwriting the most recent commit with the new one.\\n\\nThe `-m` option allows you to write the new message on the command line without opening an editor session.\\n\\nBefore changing the commit message, you can also add other changes you previously forgot:\\n\\n```git\\ngit add .\\n```\\n\\n### Pushed commit\\n\\nThe amended (changed) commit is a new entity with a different SHA-1. The previous commit will no longer exist in the current branch.\\n\\nGenerally, you should avoid amending a commit that is already pushed as it may cause issues to people who based their work on this commit. It is a good idea to consult your fellow developers before changing a pushed commit.\\n\\nIf you changed the message of the most recently pushed commit, you would have to force push it.\\n\\n1. Navigate to the repository.\\n\\n2. Amend the message of the latest pushed commit:\\n\\n```git\\ngit commit --amend -m \\"New commit message.\\"\\n```\\n\\n3. Force push to update the history of the remote repository:\\n\\n```git\\ngit push --force branch-name\\n```\\n\\n## Changing an Older or Multiple Commits\\n\\nIf you need to change the message of an older or multiple commits, you can use an interactive `git rebase` to change one or more older commits.\\n\\nThe `rebase` command rewrites the commit history, and it is strongly discouraged to rebase commits that are already pushed to the remote Git repository.\\n\\n1. Navigate to the repository containing the commit message you want to change.\\n\\n2. Type `git rebase -i HEAD~N`, where `N` is the number of commits to perform a rebase on. For example, if you want to change the 4th and the 5th latest commits, you would type:\\n\\n```git\\ngit rebase -i HEAD~5\\n```\\n\\nThe command will display the latest `X` commits in your default text editor:\\n\\n```git\\npick 43f8707f9 fix: update dependency json5 to ^2.1.1\\npick cea1fb88a fix: update dependency verdaccio to ^4.3.3\\npick aa540c364 fix: update dependency webpack-dev-server to ^3.8.2\\npick c5e078656 chore: update dependency flow-bin to ^0.109.0\\npick 11ce0ab34 fix: Fix spelling.\\n\\n# Rebase 7e59e8ead..11ce0ab34 onto 7e59e8ead (5 commands)\\n```\\n\\n3. Move to the lines of the commit message you want to change and replace `pick` with `reword`:\\n\\n```git\\nreword 43f8707f9 fix: update dependency json5 to ^2.1.1\\nreword cea1fb88a fix: update dependency verdaccio to ^4.3.3\\npick aa540c364 fix: update dependency webpack-dev-server to ^3.8.2\\npick c5e078656 chore: update dependency flow-bin to ^0.109.0\\npick 11ce0ab34 fix: Fix spelling.\\n\\n# Rebase 7e59e8ead..11ce0ab34 onto 7e59e8ead (5 commands)\\n```\\n\\n4. Save the changes and close the editor.\\n\\n5. For each chosen commit, a new text editor window will open. Change the commit message, save the file, and close the editor.\\n\\n```git\\nfix: update dependency json5 to ^2.1.1\\n```\\n\\n6. Force push the changes to the remote repository:\\n\\n```git\\ngit push --force branch-name\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTo change the most recent commit message, use the `git commit --amend` command. To change older or multiple commit messages, use `git rebase -i HEAD~N`.\\n\\nDon\u2019t amend pushed commits as it may potentially cause a lot of problems to your colleagues."},{"id":"python-pip-command","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/python-pip-command","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-01-python-pip-command.md","title":"Python pip command","description":"py -m pip freeze | findstr py","date":"2022-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 1, 2022","tags":[{"label":"python","permalink":"/blog/tags/python"},{"label":"pip","permalink":"/blog/tags/pip"}],"readingTime":1.745,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lejen","title":"Just a person","url":"https://lejencodes.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/lejencodes.png","key":"lejencodes"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"python-pip-command","title":"Python pip command","authors":["lejencodes"],"tags":["python","pip"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Changing the Most Recent Commit","permalink":"/blog/changing-the-most-recent-commit"},"nextItem":{"title":"Starting With Ghost Blogging","permalink":"/blog/starting-with-ghost-blogging"}},"content":"py -m pip freeze | findstr py\\n\\n# Upgrade Pip\\n\\n    python -m pip install --upgrade pip --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org\\n    py -m pip install --upgrade pip --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org\\n    C:\\\\Users\\\\xxx\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python38\\\\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org\\n\\n# Install Pip\\n\\n    py get-pip.py --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org\\n\\n# Pip Install command\\n\\n    pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org <package> --user\\n    py -m pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org <package> --user\\n\\n# some notes on new setup\\n\\n    python -m pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org <package> --user\\n\\n# install from whl\\n\\n    pip install some-package.whl\\n\\n# Add to path\\n\\n    C:\\\\Users\\\\xxx\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Python\\\\Python37\\\\Scripts\\n\\n# Use this to install from local drive\\n\\n    pip install ./downloads/PythonSetup3.8/flake8-3.8.3.tar.gz  --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org\\n    py -m pip install ./downloads/PythonSetup3.8/dateformat-0.9.7.tar.gz --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --user\\n\\n# Install requirement\\n\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org\\n    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org\\n\\n# When upgrading, reinstall all packages even if they are already up-to-date.\\n\\n    pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall <package> --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org\\n    pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org <package>\\n\\n    pip install -I <package>\\n    pip install --ignore-installed <package>\\n\\n# Once in a while, a Python package gets corrupted on your machine and you need to force pip to reinstall it.

Started with Github pages, uses automated workflow and get stuff compiled into a static site (Jekyll). Didn\'t like it much about having to write stuff in editor and then later you have to perform commits and pushes. So I moved on and wanted to find something with a user interface that I could interact with. Something which is free without need to spend extra $$$.\\n\\n## Hugo + Netlify + Github\\n\\nThe next try on Hugo.\\n\\nHugo is a static website engine written in Golang. Best thing about this is on the theming system, plenty of choices and everything is free. Did some search on Google, landed on some one click deployment. Messing with it for couple of days on the HTML, CSS and JS. Personal didn\'t like it due to lack of content management so went for another search on alternatives.\\n\\n## Medium, Wordpress\\n\\nRecently seeing quite a bit of content creator from Medium and Wordpress, could be possibly everyone is so free during the world pandemic, including myself. These platform don\'t really work well without spending some $$$. Content creator usually have their articles behind some pay-wall, good for people who wanted to monetize their content. I wish I could write as like the others, but too bad I don\'t.\\n\\n## Ghost\\n\\nFinally settled down with hosting Ghost with Heroku with a domain name setup with Cloudflare.\\n\\nStarting to like it due to the ease of use and user-friendly interface. Best thing about it is open source, you can customise your theme, and you have full control on how your site should look like. The default theme of Ghost (Casper), looks good enough to keep your site look clean and steady.\\n\\n## I am back to Github pages\\n\\nAfter the recent announcement on heroku no longer offer free dyno hours. I am moving back to github pages."}]}')}}]);
